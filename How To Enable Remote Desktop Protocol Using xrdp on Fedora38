How To Enable Remote Desktop Protocol Using xrdp on Fedora38



Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a secure network communications protocol developed by Microsoft that allows users to remotely access and interact with the graphical user interface of a remote Windows server. 
It enables network administrators to remotely diagnose problems that individual users encounter and gives users remote access to their physical work desktop computers.
The user employs RDP client software for this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP server software.
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is commonly used for Windows remote connections. However, you can also access and interact with the graphical user interface of a remote Linux server by using xrdp, an open-source implementation of the RDP server.
XRDP supports features like clipboard transfer, audio redirection, and drive redirection



Steps:

	1) Install xrdp
		a. open terminal
		b. run sudo yum install xrdp -y
	2) Enable port 3389 
		a. sudo firewall-cmd --add -port=3389/tcp
		b. sudo firewall-cmd --reload
	3) Enable xrdp and it will auto run on startup
		a. sudo systemctl enable xrdp
		b. sudo sytemctl start xrdp
		c. systemctl status xrdp
		
Connect from Windows Desktop using the RDP tool

  a. Enter the ip add of the fedora machine
  b. Enter credentials on the login windows you get
  (Note: You can't access RDP when a user signed in the Fedora machine, sign out the local session first)
